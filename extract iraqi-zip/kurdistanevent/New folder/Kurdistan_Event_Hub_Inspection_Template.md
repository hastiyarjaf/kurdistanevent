# üéØ Full-Stack Application Inspection & Enhancement: "Kurdistan Event Hub"

**Role:**
Act as a senior lead full-stack development inspector specializing in cultural event platforms. Your primary responsibility is to critically analyze the Kurdistan Event Hub application found at the provided local directory, audit its quality, identify gaps, and generate precise, actionable prompts to complete the "Kurdistan Event Hub" project to a production-ready standard.

## üîç Section 1: Core Inspection Directive & Target

**Target Application**: Immediately access and analyze the codebase at the provided directory:  
`C:\Users\HB LAPTOP STORE\Pictures\kurdistanevent\extract iraqi-zip\kurdistanevent\New folder`

**Thorough Analysis**: Conduct a line-by-line, component-by-component analysis. Do not assume anything works; verify everything.

**Gap Identification**: Compare the existing application against the "Kurdistan Event Hub" concept below. Create a detailed list of all missing features, non-interactive elements, broken links, and logical flaws.

**Interactive Testing**: Mentally simulate all user flows. Are buttons clickable? Do forms submit and validate? Do links navigate to the correct pages? Is state managed correctly? Does the AI search function properly?

**Prompt Generation**: For every identified issue or missing feature, your primary output must be a perfectly crafted prompt that I can feed directly back into AI Studio to command the fix or creation of the missing component.

## üèóÔ∏è Section 2: The "Kurdistan Event Hub" Application Concept

This platform is a **multilingual cultural events discovery platform** that celebrates and preserves Kurdish heritage by connecting communities to authentic cultural events, festivals, and gatherings across Kurdistan and the global diaspora.

**Core Purpose**: To revolutionize Kurdish cultural preservation and community engagement by making cultural events, traditions, and celebrations easily discoverable and accessible to Kurdish communities worldwide.

**Must-Have Features**:

### Cultural Event Discovery:
Users must be able to explore Kurdish cultural events across different regions (Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Turkey, Iran, Syria, and global diaspora communities) with dedicated sections for traditional festivals, music/dance events, art exhibitions, and food festivals.

### Editable Cultural Organizer Profiles:
Cultural Organizers must have a comprehensive dashboard they can edit. This includes their organization bio, cultural expertise (e.g., "Newroz celebrations," "traditional Kurdish music," "Kurdish cuisine"), offered cultural events/experiences, venue information, event pricing, availability, and multilingual contact information.

### AI-Powered Cultural Event Discovery:
An AI must analyze user queries in multiple languages (English, Kurdish Sorani, Kurdish Kurmanji, Arabic) to intelligently predict and suggest relevant cultural events or organizers (e.g., "traditional wedding music in Duhok" or "Newroz celebration in diaspora").

### Integrated Event Booking & Messaging:
A system for community members to message organizers directly to ask questions and RSVP to cultural events. This must include event status tracking (e.g., interested, attending, waitlisted).

### Media Sharing in Cultural Communications:
Users must be able to upload photos, videos, or documents within the messaging interface to share with organizers (e.g., sharing cultural photos, dietary restrictions for events, traditional music requests). This must include both file picker and direct camera capture options.

### Kurdish Cultural Community Features:
A section for users to post cultural stories, traditional photos, cultural questions, upcoming community events, and cultural preservation discussions to build a global Kurdish cultural community.

### Multilingual Cultural Context:
Full support for Kurdish cultural languages with proper RTL support for Kurdish and Arabic scripts, cultural calendar integration, and respect for regional Kurdish variations.
