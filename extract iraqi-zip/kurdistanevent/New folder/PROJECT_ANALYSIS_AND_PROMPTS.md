## 🔧 **What's Working**

### Core Features ✅
- **Multilingual Support**: English, Kurdish (Sorani & Kurmanji), Arabic
- **Smart AI Search**: Natural language event discovery with Gemini API
- **Event Management**: Create, view, and manage cultural events
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first, clean UI with Kurdish color scheme
- **Real-time Translation**: AI-powered content translation
- **Local Data Persistence**: Browser-based storage system

### Technical Stack ✅
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (configured in components)
- **AI**: Google Gemini API integration
- **Icons**: Custom SVG icon library
- **Localization**: Custom RTL/LTR language system

## ⚠️ **Issues to Fix**

### 1. **Missing Tailwind CSS** 🔴
The project uses Tailwind classes but doesn't have Tailwind CSS installed or configured.

### 2. **API Key Setup** 🟡
The `.env.local` file has a placeholder API key that needs to be replaced.

### 3. **Missing Data** 🟡
Some mock events have incomplete translations (see api.ts line 52).

### 4. **Build Configuration** 🟡
Vite configuration might need adjustments for proper deployment.
